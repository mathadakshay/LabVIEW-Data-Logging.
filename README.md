# LabVIEW Data Logging and Display Project

## Project Overview
This LabVIEW project demonstrates a basic data acquisition system that simulates sensor data and displays it in real-time using a waveform chart and numeric indicator.

## Features
- Generates random sensor values to simulate real-time data acquisition.
- Displays live sensor data on a waveform chart for visualization.
- Shows current sensor values numerically for precise monitoring.
- Simple and easy-to-understand LabVIEW block diagram and front panel.

## How to Use
1. Open the LabVIEW `.vi` files included in this repository.
2. Run the main VI to start the data simulation and visualization.
3. Observe the sensor values updating live on the waveform chart and numeric indicator.

## Requirements
- LabVIEW software installed (version compatible with the provided `.vi` files).
- Basic understanding of LabVIEW environment and block diagrams.

## Project Purpose
This project helps users understand basic data acquisition, visualization, and real-time monitoring using LabVIEW.
